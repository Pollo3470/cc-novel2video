Gemini can generate and process images conversationally. You can prompt either the[fast Gemini 2.5 Flash (aka Nano Banana) or the advanced Gemini 3 Pro Preview (aka Nano Banana Pro)](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation#model-selection)image models with text, images, or a combination of both, allowing you to create, edit, and iterate on visuals with unprecedented control:

- **Text, Image, and Multi-Image to Image:**Generate high-quality images from text descriptions, use text prompts to edit and adjust a given image, or use multiple input images to compose new scenes and transfer styles.
- **Iterative refinement:**Conversationally refine your image over multiple turns, making small adjustments until it's perfect.
- **High-Fidelity text rendering:**Accurately generate images that contain legible and well-placed text, ideal for logos, diagrams, and posters.

All generated images include a[SynthID watermark](https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid).

## Image generation (text-to-image)

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image

    client = genai.Client()

    prompt = (
        "Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme"
    )

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
        contents=[prompt],
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save("generated_image.png")

## Image editing (text-and-image-to-image)

**Reminder** : Make sure you have the necessary rights to any images you upload. Don't generate content that infringe on others' rights, including videos or images that deceive, harass, or harm. Your use of this generative AI service is subject to our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).

Provide an image and use text prompts to add, remove, or modify elements, change the style, or adjust the color grading.

The following example demonstrates uploading base64 encoded images. For multiple images, larger payloads, and supported MIME types, check the[Image understanding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding)page.  

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image

    client = genai.Client()

    prompt = (
        "Create a picture of my cat eating a nano-banana in a "
        "fancy restaurant under the Gemini constellation",
    )

    image = Image.open("/path/to/cat_image.png")

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
        contents=[prompt, image],
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save("generated_image.png")

### Multi-turn image editing

Keep generating and editing images conversationally. Chat or multi-turn conversation is the recommended way to iterate on images. The following example shows a prompt to generate an infographic about photosynthesis.  

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types

    client = genai.Client()

    chat = client.chats.create(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            response_modalities=['TEXT', 'IMAGE'],
            tools=[{"google_search": {}}]
        )
    )

    message = "Create a vibrant infographic that explains photosynthesis as if it were a recipe for a plant's favorite food. Show the \"ingredients\" (sunlight, water, CO2) and the \"finished dish\" (sugar/energy). The style should be like a page from a colorful kids' cookbook, suitable for a 4th grader."

    response = chat.send_message(message)

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.save("photosynthesis.png")

![AI-generated infographic about photosynthesis](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/infographic-eng.png)AI-generated infographic about photosynthesis

You can then use the same chat to change the language on the graphic to Spanish.  

### Python

    message = "Update this infographic to be in Spanish. Do not change any other elements of the image."
    aspect_ratio = "16:9" # "1:1","2:3","3:2","3:4","4:3","4:5","5:4","9:16","16:9","21:9"
    resolution = "2K" # "1K", "2K", "4K"

    response = chat.send_message(message,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
                image_size=resolution
            ),
        ))

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.save("photosynthesis_spanish.png")

## New with Gemini 3 Pro Image

Gemini 3 Pro Image (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`) is a state-of-the-art image generation and editing model optimized for professional asset production. Designed to tackle the most challenging workflows through advanced reasoning, it excels at complex, multi-turn creation and modification tasks.

- **High-resolution output**: Built-in generation capabilities for 1K, 2K, and 4K visuals.
- **Advanced text rendering**: Capable of generating legible, stylized text for infographics, menus, diagrams, and marketing assets.
- **Grounding with Google Search**: The model can use Google Search as a tool to verify facts and generate imagery based on real-time data (e.g., current weather maps, stock charts, recent events).
- **Thinking mode**: The model utilizes a "thinking" process to reason through complex prompts. It generates interim "thought images" (visible in the backend but not charged) to refine the composition before producing the final high-quality output.
- **Up to 14 reference images**: You can now mix up to 14 reference images to produce the final image.

### Use up to 14 reference images

Gemini 3 Pro Preview lets you to mix up to 14 reference images. These 14 images can include the following:

- Up to 6 images of objects with high-fidelity to include in the final image
- Up to 5 images of humans to maintain character consistency

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image

    prompt = "An office group photo of these people, they are making funny faces."
    aspect_ratio = "5:4" # "1:1","2:3","3:2","3:4","4:3","4:5","5:4","9:16","16:9","21:9"
    resolution = "2K" # "1K", "2K", "4K"

    client = genai.Client()

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents=[
            prompt,
            Image.open('person1.png'),
            Image.open('person2.png'),
            Image.open('person3.png'),
            Image.open('person4.png'),
            Image.open('person5.png'),
        ],
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            response_modalities=['TEXT', 'IMAGE'],
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
                image_size=resolution
            ),
        )
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.save("office.png")

![AI-generated office group photo](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/office-group-photo.jpeg)AI-generated office group photo

### Grounding with Google Search

Use the[Google Search tool](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search)to generate images based on real-time information, such as weather forecasts, stock charts, or recent events.

Note that when using Grounding with Google Search with image generation, image-based search results are not passed to the generation model and are excluded from the response.  

### Python

    from google import genai
    prompt = "Visualize the current weather forecast for the next 5 days in San Francisco as a clean, modern weather chart. Add a visual on what I should wear each day"
    aspect_ratio = "16:9" # "1:1","2:3","3:2","3:4","4:3","4:5","5:4","9:16","16:9","21:9"

    client = genai.Client()

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents=prompt,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            response_modalities=['Text', 'Image'],
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
            ),
            tools=[{"google_search": {}}]
        )
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.save("weather.png")

![AI-generated five day weather chart for San Francisco](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/weather-forecast.png)AI-generated five day weather chart for San Francisco

The response includes`groundingMetadata`which contains the following required fields:

- **`searchEntryPoint`**: Contains the HTML and CSS to render the required search suggestions.
- **`groundingChunks`**: Returns the top 3 web sources used to ground the generated image

### Generate images up to 4K resolution

Gemini 3 Pro Image generates 1K images by default but can also output 2K and 4K images. To generate higher resolution assets, specify the`image_size`in the`generation_config`.

You must use an uppercase 'K' (e.g., 1K, 2K, 4K). Lowercase parameters (e.g., 1k) will be rejected.  

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types

    prompt = "Da Vinci style anatomical sketch of a dissected Monarch butterfly. Detailed drawings of the head, wings, and legs on textured parchment with notes in English." 
    aspect_ratio = "1:1" # "1:1","2:3","3:2","3:4","4:3","4:5","5:4","9:16","16:9","21:9"
    resolution = "1K" # "1K", "2K", "4K"

    client = genai.Client()

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents=prompt,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            response_modalities=['TEXT', 'IMAGE'],
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
                image_size=resolution
            ),
        )
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.save("butterfly.png")

The following is an example image generated from this prompt:
![AI-generated Da Vinci style anatomical sketch of a dissected Monarch butterfly.](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/gemini3-4k-image.png)AI-generated Da Vinci style anatomical sketch of a dissected Monarch butterfly.

### Thinking Process

The Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview model is a thinking model and uses a reasoning process ("Thinking") for complex prompts. This feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled in the API. To learn more about the thinking process, see the[Gemini Thinking](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking)guide.

The model generates up to two interim images to test composition and logic. The last image within Thinking is also the final rendered image.

You can check the thoughts that lead to the final image being produced.  

### Python

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.thought:
            if part.text:
                print(part.text)
            elif image:= part.as_image():
                image.show()

#### Thought Signatures

Thought signatures are encrypted representations of the model's internal thought process and are used to preserve reasoning context across multi-turn interactions. All responses include a`thought_signature`field. As a general rule, if you receive a thought signature in a model response, you should pass it back exactly as received when sending the conversation history in the next turn. Failure to circulate thought signatures may cause the response to fail. Check the[thought signature](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thought-signatures)documentation for more explanations of signatures overall.
| **Note:** If you use the official[Google Gen AI SDKs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/libraries)and use the chat feature (or append the full model response object directly to history),**thought signatures are handled automatically**. You do not need to manually extract or manage them, or change your code.

Here is how thought signatures work:

- All`inline_data`parts with image`mimetype`which are part of the response should have signature.
- If there are some text parts at the beginning (before any image) right after the thoughts, the first text part should also have a signature.
- Thoughts do not have signatures; If`inline_data`parts with image`mimetype`are part of thoughts, they will not have signatures.

The following code shows an example of where thought signatures are included:  

    [
      {
        "inline_data": {
          "data": "<base64_image_data_0>",
          "mime_type": "image/png"
        },
        "thought": true // Thoughts don't have signatures
      },
      {
        "inline_data": {
          "data": "<base64_image_data_1>",
          "mime_type": "image/png"
        },
        "thought": true // Thoughts don't have signatures
      },
      {
        "inline_data": {
          "data": "<base64_image_data_2>",
          "mime_type": "image/png"
        },
        "thought": true // Thoughts don't have signatures
      },
      {
        "text": "Here is a step-by-step guide to baking macarons, presented in three separate images.\n\n### Step 1: Piping the Batter\n\nThe first step after making your macaron batter is to pipe it onto a baking sheet. This requires a steady hand to create uniform circles.\n\n",
        "thought_signature": "<Signature_A>" // The first non-thought part always has a signature
      },
      {
        "inline_data": {
          "data": "<base64_image_data_3>",
          "mime_type": "image/png"
        },
        "thought_signature": "<Signature_B>" // All image parts have a signatures
      },
      {
        "text": "\n\n### Step 2: Baking and Developing Feet\n\nOnce piped, the macarons are baked in the oven. A key sign of a successful bake is the development of \"feet\"---the ruffled edge at the base of each macaron shell.\n\n"
        // Follow-up text parts don't have signatures
      },
      {
        "inline_data": {
          "data": "<base64_image_data_4>",
          "mime_type": "image/png"
        },
        "thought_signature": "<Signature_C>" // All image parts have a signatures
      },
      {
        "text": "\n\n### Step 3: Assembling the Macaron\n\nThe final step is to pair the cooled macaron shells by size and sandwich them together with your desired filling, creating the classic macaron dessert.\n\n"
      },
      {
        "inline_data": {
          "data": "<base64_image_data_5>",
          "mime_type": "image/png"
        },
        "thought_signature": "<Signature_D>" // All image parts have a signatures
      }
    ]

## Other image generation modes

Gemini supports other image interaction modes based on prompt structure and context, including:

- **Text to image(s) and text (interleaved):** Outputs images with related text.
  - Example prompt: "Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."
- **Image(s) and text to image(s) and text (interleaved)** : Uses input images and text to create new related images and text.
  - Example prompt: (With an image of a furnished room) "What other color sofas would work in my space? can you update the image?"

## Generate images in batch

If you need to generate a lot of images, you can use the[Batch API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/batch-api). You get higher[rate limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)in exchange for a turnaround of up to 24 hours.

Check the[Batch API image generation documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/batch-api#image-generation)and the[cookbook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Batch_mode.ipynb)for Batch API image examples and code.

## Prompting guide and strategies

Mastering image generation starts with one fundamental principle:
> **Describe the scene, don't just list keywords.**The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words.

### Prompts for generating images

The following strategies will help you create effective prompts to generate exactly the images you're looking for.

#### 1. Photorealistic scenes

For realistic images, use photography terms. Mention camera angles, lens types, lighting, and fine details to guide the model toward a photorealistic result.  

### Template

    A photorealistic [shot type] of [subject], [action or expression], set in
    [environment]. The scene is illuminated by [lighting description], creating
    a [mood] atmosphere. Captured with a [camera/lens details], emphasizing
    [key textures and details]. The image should be in a [aspect ratio] format.

### Prompt

    A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with
    deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully
    inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic,
    sun-drenched workshop. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light
    streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay.
    Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background
    (bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful. Vertical portrait
    orientation.

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types    

    client = genai.Client()

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
        contents="A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop with pottery wheels and shelves of clay pots in the background. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay and the fabric of his apron. Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful.",
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save("photorealistic_example.png")

![A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist...](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/photorealistic_example.png)A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist...

#### 2. Stylized illustrations \& stickers

To create stickers, icons, or assets, be explicit about the style and request a transparent background.  

### Template

    A [style] sticker of a [subject], featuring [key characteristics] and a
    [color palette]. The design should have [line style] and [shading style].
    The background must be transparent.

### Prompt

    A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat. It's
    munching on a green bamboo leaf. The design features bold, clean outlines,
    simple cel-shading, and a vibrant color palette. The background must be white.

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types

    client = genai.Client()

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
        contents="A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat. It's munching on a green bamboo leaf. The design features bold, clean outlines, simple cel-shading, and a vibrant color palette. The background must be white.",
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save("red_panda_sticker.png")

#### 3. Accurate text in images

Gemini excels at rendering text. Be clear about the text, the font style (descriptively), and the overall design. Use Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview for professional asset production.  

### Template

    Create a [image type] for [brand/concept] with the text "[text to render]"
    in a [font style]. The design should be [style description], with a
    [color scheme].

### Prompt

    Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The Daily Grind'. The text should be in a clean, bold, sans-serif font. The color scheme is black and white. Put the logo in a circle. Use a coffee bean in a clever way.

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types    

    client = genai.Client()

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents="Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The Daily Grind'. The text should be in a clean, bold, sans-serif font. The color scheme is black and white. Put the logo in a circle. Use a coffee bean in a clever way.",
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio="1:1",
            )
        )
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()
            image.save("logo_example.jpg")

#### 7. Character consistency: 360 view

You can generate 360-degree views of a character by iteratively prompting for different angles. For best results, include previously generated images in subsequent prompts to maintain consistency. For complex poses, include a reference image of the desired pose.  

### Template

    A studio portrait of [person] against [background], [looking forward/in profile looking right/etc.]

### Prompt

    A studio portrait of this man against white, in profile looking right

### Python

    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image

    client = genai.Client()

    image_input = Image.open('/path/to/your/man_in_white_glasses.jpg')
    text_input = """A studio portrait of this man against white, in profile looking right"""

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents=[text_input, image_input],
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.text is not None:
            print(part.text)
        elif part.inline_data is not None:
            image = part.as_image()

### Best Practices

To elevate your results from good to great, incorporate these professional strategies into your workflow.

- **Be Hyper-Specific:**The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
- **Provide Context and Intent:** Explain the*purpose*of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output. For example, "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" will yield better results than just "Create a logo."
- **Iterate and Refine:**Don't expect a perfect image on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes. Follow up with prompts like, "That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?" or "Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious."
- **Use Step-by-Step Instructions:**For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn. Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar. Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."
- **Use "Semantic Negative Prompts":**Instead of saying "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
- **Control the Camera:** Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like`wide-angle shot`,`macro shot`,`low-angle
  perspective`.

## Limitations

- For best performance, use the following languages: EN, ar-EG, de-DE, es-MX, fr-FR, hi-IN, id-ID, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, ru-RU, ua-UA, vi-VN, zh-CN.
- Image generation does not support audio or video inputs.
- The model won't always follow the exact number of image outputs that the user explicitly asks for.
- `gemini-2.5-flash-image`works best with up to 3 images as input, while`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`supports 5 images with high fidelity, and up to 14 images in total.
- When generating text for an image, Gemini works best if you first generate the text and then ask for an image with the text.
- All generated images include a[SynthID watermark](https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid).

## Optional configurations

You can optionally configure the response modalities and aspect ratio of the model's output in the`config`field of`generate_content`calls.

### Output types

The model defaults to returning text and image responses (i.e.`response_modalities=['Text', 'Image']`). You can configure the response to return only images without text using`response_modalities=['Image']`.  

### Python

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
        contents=[prompt],
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            response_modalities=['Image']
        )
    )

### Aspect ratios and image size

The model defaults to matching the output image size to that of your input image, or otherwise generates 1:1 squares. You can control the aspect ratio of the output image using the`aspect_ratio`field under`image_config`in the response request, shown here:  

### Python

    # For gemini-2.5-flash-image
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
        contents=[prompt],
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio="16:9",
            )
        )
    )

    # For gemini-3-pro-image-preview
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents=[prompt],
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio="16:9",
                image_size="2K",
            )
        )
    )

The different ratios available and the size of the image generated are listed in the following tables:
